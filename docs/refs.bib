  abstract={We present an efficient version of the Horner scheme for the evaluation of multivariate
polynomials and study its stability properties. In particular, we show that the backward error of
evaluation is bounded by a quantity that is linear in the total degree of the polynomial, which itself
is usually significantly smaller than the number of operations involved in the evaluation process.
Moreover, we show that the same type of estimates holds also for the forward error, provided that
the polynomial basis is chosen suitably.},

  pages={2391--2395},

  publisher={Elsevier},
    abstract={Optimizing the cost of evaluating a polynomial is a classic problem in computer science. For polynomials in one variable, Horner’s method provides a scheme for producing a computationally
efficient form. For multivariate polynomials it is possible to generalize Horner’s method, but this
leaves freedom in the order of the variables. Traditionally, greedy schemes like most-occurring vari-
able first are used. This simple textbook algorithm has given remarkably efficient results. Finding
better algorithms has proved difficult. In trying to improve upon the greedy scheme we have im-
plemented Monte Carlo tree search, a recent search method from the field of artificial intelligence.
This results in better Horner schemes and reduces the cost of evaluating polynomials, sometimes by
factors up to two.},
