Installation
------------

Installation with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install multivar_horner



For efficiency this package is compiling the instructions required for polynomial evaluation to C by default.
If you don't have a C compiler (``gcc`` or ``cc``) installed you also need to install numba for using an alternative method:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install multivar_horner[numba]



Basics
------

Let's consider this example multivariate polynomial:

:math:`p(x) = 5 + 1 x_1^3 x_2^1 + 2 x_1^2 x_3^1 + 3 x_1^1 x_2^1 x_3^1`


Which can also be written as:

:math:`p(x) = 5 x_1^0 x_2^0 x_3^0 + 1 x_1^3 x_2^1 x_3^0 + 2 x_1^2 x_2^0 x_3^1 + 3 x_1^1 x_2^1 x_3^1`


A polynomial is a sum of monomials.
Our example polynomial has :math:`M = 4` monomials and dimensionality :math:`N = 3`.

The coefficients of our example polynomial are: 5.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0

The exponent vectors of the corresponding monomials are:

* [0, 0, 0]
* [3, 1, 0]
* [2, 0, 1]
* [1, 1, 1]

To represent polynomials this package requires the coefficients and the exponent vectors as input.

This code shows how to compute the Horner factorisation of our example polynomial :math:`p`
and evaluating :math:`p` at a point :math:`x`:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from multivar_horner import HornerMultivarPolynomial

    coefficients = np.array([[5.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=np.float64)  # shape: (M,1)
    exponents = np.array(
        [[0, 0, 0], [3, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]], dtype=np.uint32
    )  # shape: (M,N)
    p = HornerMultivarPolynomial(coefficients, exponents)

    x = np.array([-2.0, 3.0, 1.0], dtype=np.float64)  # shape: (1,N)
    p_x = p(x)  # -29.0



.. note::

    with the default settings the input is required to have these data types and shapes
